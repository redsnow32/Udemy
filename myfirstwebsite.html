<h2>A Few Facts About Me</h2>

<br /><br />
<p>I was born and raised in Pleasant Grove Utah. I graduated high school in 2006 where
   I then went to work construction for two years. I got married in 2008 to my lovely wife Ashley.
   She convinced me to take a shot at school so I started going to school in
   the fall of 2008 at Utah Valley University. I graduated with an exercise science
   degree with the intentions of going to medical school. I decided medical school was
   not the best option for me so I talked to my cousin who is a technical recruiter.
   He got me a job as a software account manager at a start up company. I started
   dealing with a little code on the side and decided I thought this was a great option!
   So here I am teaching myself to code!
